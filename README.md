# Comp-Team

This repo is for the use of the Comp Team that does Market Research, case studies, and wins trading comps.

# Instructions for Repository

Please make a new branch per major task and create pull requests to origin/master branch. Please make sure you
rebase your branch with master before merging your pull request to avoid any merge conflicts!!! This will also keep the commit history linear.

This is unlikely to happen as you will probably not work on each other's team folders.

Make sure your whole team is working off a branch or two (ensure branches are limited to major changes).

Tag your branch with the corresponding team label and assign one of the required reviewers:

- Jaimil
- Michael

The reason for this is to learn how to collaborate, keep consistency + standards, and document our work for future devs and reference.

./delta is the directory for all of Delta team's work

./gamma is the directory for all of Gamma team's work

./theta is the directory for all of Theta team's work

See corresponding README's in each subfolder for more information

# Important Paths

./.resources has all important resources and case studies will be posted there, mostly used by exec team to add stuff, but it is more of a "Collective" folder for everyone to add stuff in. Feel free to make new PR's to add new documentation or anything you think is helpful.
