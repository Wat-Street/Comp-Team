"""
This script computes and visualizes the correlation matrix of a selected set of
stocks using Polygon's API. This script is for educational purposes only and is
not intended to provide investment advice. The examples provided analyze the 
correlation between different stocks from diverse sectors, as well as within 
specific sectors.

Before running this script, there are 4 prerequisites:

1) Dependencies: Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed in 
   your environment:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - seaborn
   - matplotlib.pyplot
   - polygon's python-client library

   You can likely run:
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib polygon-api-client

2) API Key: You will need a Polygon API key to fetch the stock data. This can 
   be set manually in the script below, or you can set an environment variable 
   'POLYGON_API_KEY'.

   setx POLYGON_API_KEY "<your_api_key>"   <- windows
   export POLYGON_API_KEY="<your_api_key>" <- mac/linux

3) Select Stocks: You need to select the stocks you're interested in analyzing.
   Update the 'symbols' variable in this script with your chosen stock symbols.

4) Select Date Range: You need to specify the date range for the historical 
   data that you want to fetch. Update the 'start_date' and 'end_date' 
   variables in this script accordingly.

Understanding stock correlation is important when building a diverse portfolio,
as it can help manage risk and inform investment strategies. It's always 
essential to do your own research or consult a financial advisor for 
personalized advice when investing.
